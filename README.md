## 2. Credit Card Fraud Detection ðŸ’³

### Problem Statement
Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using transaction data.

### Features
- **Dataset**: Information about credit card transactions, anonymized for security.
- **Algorithms**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
- **Evaluation**: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score used to assess the models.

### Results
The model can effectively classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## 3. Spam SMS Detection ðŸ“©

### Problem Statement
Develop a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.

### Features
- **Dataset**: Includes SMS messages labeled as "spam" or "ham."
- **Text Processing**: TF-IDF vectorization and Count Vectorizer for feature extraction.
- **Modeling**:
  - Naive Bayes
